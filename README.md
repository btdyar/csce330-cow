# COW Programming Language
## How to Compile
1. Clone this git repository
2. Run `make` to compile the interpreter
3. Use `./cowcomp.out` to run any .cow file
	1. For example 1, run `./cowcomp.out i.cow`
	2. For example 2, run `./cowcomp.out fib.cow`
	3. Example 3 is TBD
## NOTE THAT YOU WILL NEED SOME WAY OF COMPILING C++ CODE
Use something like WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), a VM, or SSH into a lab machine.
